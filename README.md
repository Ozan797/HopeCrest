# HopeCrest: Breast Cancer Survival Prediction Machine Learning Model
Breast cancer is a prevalent cancer affecting both men and women and stands as the second leading cause of death in women. Utilizing data-driven approaches like machine learning aids in predicting patient survival post-surgery. This documentation outlines the process of building a predictive model for breast cancer survival using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset encompasses records of over 400 breast cancer patients post-surgery. It contains the following columns:

- Patient_ID: Unique identifier of the patient
- Age: Age of the patient
- Gender: Gender of the patient (FEMALE/MALE)
- Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4: Expression levels
- Tumor_Stage: Stage of breast cancer
- Histology: Type of carcinoma
- ER status, PR status, HER2 status: Biomarker status
- Surgery_type: Type of surgery performed
- DateofSurgery: Date of the surgery
- DateofLast_Visit: Date of the last patient visit
- Patient_Status: Survival status (Alive/Dead)

## Conclusion
Utilizing machine learning techniques facilitates the prediction of breast cancer patient survival post-surgery. The model trained on this dataset showcases the potential of data-driven approaches in healthcare. This documentation aims to guide and empower further exploration and advancements in this critical domain.
